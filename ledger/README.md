# Program on Implementing Ledger Support

We've received numerous requests for Ledger support and as a decentrilised project with a diverse and talented community we decided to follow the example of projects like Kusama and Polkadot and offer the community to code the integration with Ledger for a reward.


### So, here's the deal

If you are a C programmer and ready for the challenge, following is the list of requirements for the integration.
**The first developer to have the work finished and tested by the team will get the reward.**
You can, of course, form teams and then divide the reward between the teammates.

Operations that should be supported by Ledger integration:

1. Base architecture and Transfers - will be rewarded with **$2400 equivalent of VAL tokens**
2. Swaps and Add/remove liquidity - will be rewarded with **$1200 equivalent of VAL tokens**
3. Bridge transfers and rewards claiming - will be rewarded with **$1200 equivalent of VAL tokens**

The implementation is divided into milestones. 
The first and and the most important operation is to implement base architecture and transfer. 
When this operation is completed, more people can work in parallel adding the other features.

#### The team will

- provide technical support and API docs

#### The team will NOT

- teach how to develop in C programming language
- teach how to use git
- buy a Ledger for testing
